Crop Analysis (IAS-Data)
Crop production is a crucial aspect of agriculture, directly influencing food security and the economy. Analyzing crop production trends, soil quality, weather conditions, and external factors can help farmers and policymakers optimize yield, reduce losses, and ensure sustainability. However, challenges such as unpredictable weather, soil degradation, and improper crop selection hinder efficient production.

Expected Outcomes:

✔️ Identify trends and patterns in crop production.

✔️ Provide insights for better farming practices.

✔️ Help farmers select suitable crops for their land conditions.

✔️ Improve productivity and sustainability in agriculture.
